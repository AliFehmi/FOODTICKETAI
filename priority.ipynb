      "Good afternoon I wanted to follow up with you all regarding the issue with Capital Christian Fellowships produce hub earlier this week CCF adds food and edits the SO I make for their produce hubs In the past few months they have added thousands of pounds of food to these orders making them close to 40k pounds sometimes For the most recent hub order someone at CCF accidentally removed 3k pounds of produce meant for the produce hub Christ let me know that this can happen since the produce is marked as available for agencies and CAFB staff We are having a meeting tomorrow with CCF to discuss the produce hub orders I wanted to reach out to you all to get your insight on whether it would be beneficial for TransportationOps if I told CCF that they cannot addmodify produce hub SOs anymore However I wouldnt want CCF to create additional orders during the same time and further strain the capacity of TransportationOps If there is a specific pound limit that I should tell them not to exceed when adding food to the produce hub SOs I can do that as well I know that the produce limitations will impact their ordering so their order sizes will probably decrease in the next few months Please let me know if there is anything you would like me to mention during the meeting tomorrow Thank you again for all your help\n",

      "Ms Jackson Gaithersburg HELP is an allvolunteer organization that has been serving the needy in our local community for 56 years and we are dedicated to supporting as many families with food each month as we can In fact last month HELP served 500 families at our pantry in the Festival Shopping Center We have only a couple of volunteer drivers who can deliver food and we must reserve that service for those individuals who live alone or have a partner who also cant drive to the pantry You had asked for us to deliver food to a family of 9 people As you must know from your previous food pickups which total 30 since 2018 we pack according to family size so a family of 9 would receive at least 8 heavy bags of groceries We simply cant ask a volunteer all of whom tend to be over 60 years of age to pick up and deliver many bags of groceries and that would not be appropriate when there are ablebodied family members in residence As an allvolunteer organization we strive to serve as many families as possible but we can sustain our operation only if almost all of our families pick up at the pantry If a client needs to come to the pantry via bus we offer bus tokens so that transportation to and from the pantry is free It is not an insult to let someone know that we have limited capabilities for food delivery Its just a fact And we would not ask to see proof of disability We explain our limited delivery ability to any client who asks about delivery Also our coordinators always provide information about how to get food from Manna andor the Gaithersburg Hope Center Clients can get food from us while also getting food from those other organizations In that way we hope clients find they have more money to apply toward rent or utility bills Our yearly client survey results validate that outcome and that our volunteers treat clients with dignity and promptness We could serve your family very quickly with food if someone could drive to the pantry or come via bus Margo On Thu Nov 14 2024 at 211PM Yvette Jackson via Info wrote Dear Capital Area Food Bank Support Team My name is Yvette Jackson and I am writing to report an issue I experienced with food assistance delivery from Gaithersburg HELP On Monday at 936 am I called to apply for food assistance delivery but my request was refused based on the number of people in my household and our ages Specifically this refusal has caused significant inconveniences and insult to my family and me as we urgently need food assistance Insulting my family by indicating shows a lack of empathy and compassion After making a complaint I received a response at 1254 pm today indicating that the refusal and statement were correct due to the volunteer nature of the service and their inability to deliver help to a large household I was directed to seek assistance from other sources such as Manna Food I believe there might be a misunderstanding or miscommunication regarding our eligibility for this service Attached to this email you will find documentation of my disability for your review Please note the MetroAccess document on line 16 which indicates that my disability prevents me from independently using the accessible Metrobus and Metrorail system for all trips I am unable to walk due to L spine disease with a risk of falls panic attacks anxiety and nontolerance to crowds At this point I feel my disability age and household circumstances are severely limiting my access to essential help I would appreciate your assistance in reviewing this matter and providing any necessary support to ensure that my household can receive the food assistance we need as it appears Gaithersburg Help is not completely meeting the needs of the community I value your prompt attention to this issue and look forward to your response\n",

      "Lucy First let me thank you and the TEFAP program for allowing us to serve We have been a part of the Capital Area Food Bank since 2009 thats 15 years of service The volunteers that come to work with us do so at the kindness of their heart Our Community is multcultural People who are afraid of the impact of completing the form At the Civil Rights meeting I asked the question of how we can educate the community to help them understand that they wouldnt lose their benefits by completing the form By saying you cant have food unless you fill out the form is heartbreaking We are doing what we can and to constantly be threatened of suspension is not a good feeling I cant imagine any agency taking such steps over FOOD These volunteers have worked tirelessly If you need to come and get the foods we have please feel free to do so Let us know the date and time so that someone will be available I spoke to Cynthia and she informed me that NO TEFAP Food was distributed in August I will do the inventory send you the forms we collected and that is all we can do Best Dr Claudine Head On Thu Oct 24 2024 at 934AM Lucy Paredes wrote Good Morning Dr Head I thought it would be best to answer on this email thread as you can more easily refer back to the Corrective Action Plan attached to the first email I appreciate you sending along the pictures of the temperature logs and the civil rights training certificate The Corrective Action Plan outlines 2 issues the missing SDI forms and missing inventory reports The due date of 10232024 was for the signed Corrective Action Plan to be emailed back to me along with a plan to prevent this issue from happening again in the future please see the last bullet point below each issue and lastly the missing inventory reports to be submitted In your case that is May and August of 2024 Like said in one of the emails below if you submitted the missing months you should have received an email with a PDF copy via email If you could send me that then it would clear up the missing inventory reports Since I will be out of town tomorrow Friday 1025 and Monday 1028 I will allow for one additional extension The new date is Wednesday October 30th 2024 Please know that if these items are not submitted by end of day on October 30th there will be a suspension placed on your TEFAP account Any suspension that I do does not impact your ability to order regular CAFB food To recap the final submission deadline for the signed CAP summaries and missing reports are due by End of Day 5pm on Wednesday October 30th I hope this clarifies any confusion Best Lucy Lucy Paredes MD TEFAP Coordinator Capital Area Food Bank P 2026449800 M 2029849515 F 2025271767 lparedes 4900 Puerto Rico Ave NE Washington DC 20017 _New Hope And Life School of Religion Theology Seminary_ _8616 Edgeworth Drive_ _Capitol Heights MD 20743_ _301 3245200_ _301 3247100 fax_ _ Proverbs 99_ _New Hope And Life School of Religion Theology Seminary_ _8616 Edgeworth Drive_ _Capitol Heights MD 20743_ _301 3245200_ _301 3247100 fax_ __ __ _ Proverbs 99_\n",

    "#     text = str(text).lower()\n",
    "#     score = {\"High\": 0, \"Medium\": 0, \"Low\": 0}\n",
    "#     # Suppose high_keywords, medium_keywords, and low_keywords are sets of words obtained from the above analysis\n",

    "#         if re.search(r'\\b' + re.escape(word) + r'\\b', text):\n",
    "#             score[\"High\"] += 1\n",
    "#     for word in medium_keywords:\n",
    "#         if re.search(r'\\b' + re.escape(word) + r'\\b', text):\n",
    "#             score[\"Medium\"] += 1\n",
    "#     for word in low_keywords:\n",
    "#         if re.search(r'\\b' + re.escape(word) + r'\\b', text):\n",
    "#             score[\"Low\"] += 1\n",
    "#     # Return the priority with the highest score\n",
    "#     return max(score, key=score.get)\n",
    "#\n",
    "# You can refine this rule-based classifier by adjusting weights or thresholds.\n",
    "#\n",
