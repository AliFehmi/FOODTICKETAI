Thank you!_ \\n\\nGood afternoon,\\n\\nThank you for submitting this ticket to Customer Service. I have reviewed your reported issues and consulted with my colleagues in our Food Resources and Operations Teams.\\n\\nRegarding the tortillas, I apologize that they were sent out after their expiration date. I have reported this to the Food Resources Team for further investigation. However, since you received them, I have processed a credit of $45.60 for the tortillas you ordered (which had a discount applied). This credit will be applied to the invoice associated with your order, Invoice #180569.\\n\\nAs for the flavored water, the date on the items indicated \"BB,\" which stands for \"best by.\" Many of our donated foods may be past their best by or sell by dates. These dates are intended to inform you of when the item is not at its peak quality, not about food safety. The items are still safe to consume, and we encourage our partners to use their judgment. If there are any signs of concernâ€”such as changes in taste, smell, or packagingâ€”do not distribute the item and please let us know.\\n\\n[^Food Coding Guidance.pdf]\\n\\nThank you,\\n\\n\"D\"', 'Comment.10': '10/29/2024 03:57;63a625d8347fae534682c9b1;{color:#172B4D}Thank you!

I will double-check to ensure this process is still in place, as we established a notes section specifically for partners to provide important information for our drivers.  Additionally, I want to mention that there are times when drivers may finish their deliveries earlier than expected, or we may have more drivers available than anticipated. In such cases, drivers are instructed to call you to ask if you would like to receive your order before your scheduled delivery window. If you decline, they should wait until your designated delivery window.  I will reach out to confirm these details and will follow up with you.

More importantly, it is mandatory for them to call all partners before their deliveries, even if they are within the designated delivery window. This call is to inform you that they are on their way.

I hope you are doing well. This is feedback that we have received across the regions and I have communicated it to the Operations Teams for their awareness. For now, please relay the message below to the partner: \\n\\n_Good afternoon- The Customer Relations Team has reported your concerns to our Senior Managers in Operations, and they are committed to helping our partners address these challenges. They will be reviewing options to improve the situation moving forward. For the time being, items will continue to be packed as they are currently, but the team is looking into alternatives that would make unpacking easier for you and other agencies.  I will keep you updated on any developments. I want to assure you that your feedback has been heard and is being taken into consideration.   The reason for the current packing method is due to truck capacity. If the pallets are not stacked, they will take up more space in the truck and could potentially require multiple trucks for delivery. Our drivers carry pallet jacks with them on their routes, but they do not have reach machines like those used in the warehouse to pull orders and unstack items.  We are working on this, and I apologize for the challenges it presents.

I wanted to bring this matter to Austin and discuss it with her. I understand the implications of the large orders and the concerns surrounding the removal of produce for the produce hub. When I spoke to Austin, she suggested that the first step should be to have a conversation with the partner to explain the implications of their edits to the order. They need to be mindful that they donâ€™t want to lose their produce items meant for the hub and that they should be aware of the weight of their orders when placing them.  \\n\\nHere are two key points I discussed with Austin:  \\n\\n1. Currently, we do not have a formal limit for orders, so we cannot tell them what a limit would be. Operations and ERP/IT are working on measures to ensure that for large orders, the number of delivery blocks corresponds appropriately. For example, two weeks ago, Capital Christianâ€™s order required five trucks for delivery but only occupied one slot, which is unrealistic. For now, we can only ensure that Operations is aware and prepared for these situations.\\n\\n 2. Austin mentioned that if this situation continues to cause recurring issues and impacts the produce hub\\'s participating sitesâ€”resulting in a loss of produceâ€”we can consider locking their orders for the produce hubs and requesting that they create a separate order. However, this could complicate matters since Operations has asked us to consolidate orders for the same partner to avoid having one sales order versus two. We can explore this locking option as a last resort if recurring issues continue. \\n\\n I hope this clarifies the situation, and please let me know if you need any assistance in engaging with the partner. \\n\\n Best,  \\n\\n \"D\"'}, {'Resolved': '09/25/2024 12:20', 'Description': 'good afternoon hope week good start', 'Custom field (Cause of issue)': 'Request of Customer Relations', 'Custom field (Request Category)': 'Orders - Pre delivery -> Data/Time Change - Reschedule', 'Custom field (Source)': 'Email to Jira', 'Comment': '09/17/2024 03:25;712020:b15fa988-bc60-49b4-aa6f-e30b7a3629c1;Good afternoon, \\n\\nThank you for contacting customer support.

I understand how quickly these items can disappear from the menu, and I encourage you to check it daily, as we frequently add new products. Right now, we also have vegetable oil, stuffing mix, corn muffin mix, canned collard greens, and beans that might help supplement your holiday distributions. \\n\\n  \\n\\nPlease feel free to check the menu regularly, and if I see any additional turkeys come available, I will reach out to you. \\n\\n  \\n\\nThank you for your understanding, and know that we are here to support you and your community during this important time. \\n\\n  \\n\\nWarm regards,  \\n\\n\"D\"{color:#4E8227}{color} \\n\\n  \\n\\n!image001.png|thumbnail!{color:#4E8227}{color} \\n\\n *{color:#4E8227} *DH*{color}*{color:#4E8227}{color} \\n\\n{color:#4E8227}Manager of Customer Relations & Distribution Network Evolution{color}{color:#4E8227}{color} \\n\\n {color:#4E8227}Capital Area Food Bank{color}{color:#4E8227}{color} \\n\\n *{color:#4E8227} *P.*{color}*{color:#4E8227} 571.390.9875 |  *F.* 703.541.0179{color}{color:#4E8227}{color} \\n\\n[{color:#0563C1}dharmon@capitalareafoodbank.org{color}|mailto:dharmon@capitalareafoodbank.org] \\n\\n{color:#3A7C22}4900 Puerto Rico Ave, NE Washington DC 20017{color}{color:#4E8227}{color}{color:windowtext}{color} \\n\\n  \\n\\n!image002.png|thumbnail!{color:windowtext}{color} <[https://www.facebook.com/CapitalAreaFoodBank]>{color:windowtext}{color}!image003.png|thumbnail!{color:windowtext}{color} <[https://www.linkedin.com/company/capitalareafoodbank]>{color:windowtext}{color} !image004.png|thumbnail!{color:windowtext}{color} <[https://twitter.com/foodbankmetrodc]>{color:windowtext}{color} !image005.png|thumbnail!{color:windowtext}{color} <[https://www.instagram.com/capitalareafoodbank/]> \\n\\n  \\n\\n{color:red}Please email all customer service questions or concerns to{color} [{color:red} {color}{color:red} *partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org*{color}{color:red} {color}|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org]{color:red} so that one of my colleagues or I can assist you promptly.

We want to ensure that all the food leaving our warehouse is safe for consumption and properly dated for your knowledge. Some of the items you mentioned are *donated products*. As we increase the donated products on our menu, I want to make sure that all partners are aware that Capital Area Food Bank accepts donations with items past their best by and sell by dates.\\n\\nThe best by date is an indicator of the quality of a product but is not a safety date. The sell by date is for inventory management and tells the store for how long to display the product for sale. The product can still be consumed after this date. It\\'s important to note that many of our donated products will be past these dates, but they are not expired and are still safe for consumption.\\n\\nWe have food coding guides that partners can print and reference during distributions. When available, they can be ordered in English and Spanish from our Nutrition Education Department. The dates on some products may cause concerns for partners and their clients, but we urge you all to differentiate between the different dates on products, use the food coding guide as a reference, and also use your best judgment as well as your food safety knowledge. If you have a product that is not of the right consistency, has an odor, or you believe to be not okay, please let us know and discard the item immediately. As we increase our donations, we may encounter some challenges, but please work with us and continue to provide us with feedback.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you ever have an issue with fresh produce, please include photos of the items so that we can forward them to our Operations and Food Resourcing Departments for their knowledge.\\n\\nWe appreciate your partnership with us in this.\\n\\nFor Nutrition Materials including the Food Coding Guide, please email: [education@capitalareafoodbank.org|mailto:education@capitalareafoodbank.org]\\n\\n[^Food Coding Guidance.pdf]\\n\\n\"D\"'}, {'Resolved': '10/24/2024 11:26', 'Description': 'good morning weight limit include dry item just fresh fruit vegetable thank', 'Custom field (Cause of issue)': 'Partner Knowledge/Training', 'Custom field (Request Category)': 'Menu -> General Questions', 'Custom field (Source)': 'Email to Jira', 'Comment': '10/24/2024 11:26;712020:38c82492-84fe-40dc-8901-61d65a68f6d3;Good morning and thank you for contacting customer support. 15,000lbs is the limit for produce only.

I wanted to talk to you about the ticket you submitted. I apologize for the delay. One of my team members brought up your concerns regarding some items you received from us. After discussing your concerns about the salad dressing with my management and the Food Sourcing Team responsible for all the food that comes into the Food Bank, here are some points I wanted to share with you.\\n\\nRegarding the salad dressing, our Food Resourcing Team does not have a specific recommendation for shelf-stable milk or salad dressing in our Food Coding Guide. We suggest following the USDA\\'s recommendation regarding this product specifically and apologize for not being able to provide further insight. Partners and clients should use their eyes, noses, and, taste buds to determine if a food is spoiled and therefore unsafe to eat. Of course, if a product is showing any signs of spoilage such as rot, mold, foul odor, etc., we will accept a return. I have brought this issue to management\\'s attention, and I agree that our Food Coding Guide needs improvement. I will raise this with our leadership for further review.\\n\\nIn response to your second point, I acknowledge the importance of best-by dates for our partners and their clients. However, our team faces challenges in obtaining these dates for donated products. One challenge arises during packing events when volunteers check and pack donated items into cases labeled as assorted on the menu. These assorted cases contain items from various donors and are packed without specific best-by date information for each individual product. Another challenge occurs when we receive donated products in different case lots-with different dates, making it difficult to provide accurate best-by dates to our partners. We don\\'t know what case lot your order is going to be pulled from until its pulled the day before or two before its delivered or picked up. Although we practice FIFO (first in, first out) inventory management, the dynamic nature of our inventory makes it challenging to predict best-by dates with certainty. As our inventory of donated products increases, we are committed to improving our processes to provide partners with the information they need to make informed decisions. We are continuously seeking ways to improve our processes, and I encourage partners to participate in the upcoming  Partner meetings in July to address any questions or recommendations regarding product dates.\\n\\nThank you for bringing these concerns to our attention.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\n\\n\"D\"'}, {'Resolved': '08/21/2024 03:43', 'Description': 'possible quality check item last time order kale most leave yellow however able check item driver leave end weed box green leave thank sincerely', 'Custom field (Cause of issue)': 'Ops Issue', 'Custom field (Request Category)': 'Menu -> General Questions', 'Custom field (Source)': 'Email to Jira', 'Comment': '08/19/2024 10:36;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;Hi drey_v27@yahoo.com, \\n\\nThank you for contacting the Capital Area Food Bankâ€™s Customer Relations Department!

A few weeks ago, we communicated to all our agency partners about the challenges we have been facing with inventory and operations. We acknowledge the impact this has on our partners and their distributions. We are working internally to address this issue by conducting more inventory calibration and providing additional training for our staff to improve accuracy in our Operations Department.

I wanted to write to you regarding the missing items list. I have been in communication with our Operations Department about the issue with your order. After searching the warehouse and conducting some internal inventory recalculations, we have identified inventory errors and mispicking for this order. A few weeks ago, we communicated to all our agency partners about the challenges we have been facing with inventory and operations. We acknowledge the impact this has on our partners and their distributions. We are working internally to address this issue by conducting more inventory calibration and providing additional training for our staff to improve accuracy in our Operations Department. Unfortunately, these items cannot be redelivered as we no longer have them. I understand this is frustrating and have reported this incident, as well as others from our partners, to my leadership. We are dedicated to improving your experience with us and want to ensure you have a better experience.

I appreciate your inquiry. We offer a variety of fruits and vegetables on our menu throughout the week, but the selection can vary depending on seasonal availability. During the winter months, for example, we typically have fewer options compared to the summer when a wider variety of produce is available. \\n\\nIn recent weeks, the fruits and vegetables available have primarily included potatoes, apples, and carrots. Due to producelimitations placed on agencies, our Food Resources Team is working to bring in more produce items in case lot instead of large bins and full pallets, but this remains an ongoing challenge. Currently, all produce items must be ordered through PartnerLink, as there are no plans to reopen the agency mart for direct pickups.\\n\\nI have two suggestions to enhance your experience in this situation. First, you can place orders up to 10 days in advance of your scheduled pickup and delivery date. I recommend placing your order as soon as the calendar opens and frequently checking PartnerLink for available produce. You can edit and add to your order until it locks for fulfillment, which is three business days prior to the shipment date. This flexibility allows you to include any additional items you may find during that 10-day window.\\n\\nAnother option is to explore our TEFAP program, a government-subsidized initiative through which participating partners can access additional items to supplement their regular orders.

Regarding the Produce Boxes, we have contacted your Regional Coordinators, Grace and Augusta, and they will communicate with Coastalâ€™s Customer Service Team to address the problem with your produce boxes that were not distributable. Augusta has offered to follow up with them and relay any next steps back to you.\\n\\nAs for the peanut butter, thank you for providing photos. We appreciate it. The peanut butter in your order, as well as many of our other donated items, have passed their \"best by\" date. This date indicates when the product will be at its best flavor or quality and is not a safety date. Itâ€™s a quality date that encourages consumers to eat food while it is in its prime state. Food that is past this date is not bad and should not be thrown away. We provide a food coding guide to our partners that explains these dates further. We want to reassure you that the peanut butter is not expired and will not cause any harm to consumers. We offer the Food Coding Guides as a resource and we have them printed and available to order for partners as well to pass out at distributions. \\n\\n[^Food Coding Guidance.pdf]\\n\\nThank you,\\n\\n\"D\"'}, {'Resolved': '01/29/2025 09:06', 'Description': 'automate report let know delivery returnedrejecte take look report attach email more info', 'Custom field (Cause of issue)': 'Request of Customer Relations', 'Custom field (Request Category)': 'Return Notification -> Daily Report', 'Custom field (Source)': 'Email to Jira', 'Comment': '01/28/2025 10:01;qm:65d20c5a-0c84-458e-8ce1-adb90d07460f:731a0b6a-173e-4eec-88c6-921bcb4b9e4f;\\n\\n[^searchresults.csv] _(0.1 kB)_', 'Comment.1': '01/29/2025 09:05;61536ea272f6970069fc1dbd;{{RMA3435 has been created for this order. }}'}, {'Resolved': '06/17/2024 10:38', 'Description': 'greeting unable make pick tomorrow reschedule jury duty attend sincerely write good morning email confirm schedule pickup tomorrow so select pickup window am am thoroughly review sign order leave recommend bring copy order question call phone number email', 'Custom field (Cause of issue)': 'Request of Customer Relations', 'Custom field (Request Category)': 'Orders - Pre delivery -> Data/Time Change - Reschedule', 'Custom field (Source)': 'Email to Jira', 'Comment': '06/16/2024 08:02;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;Hi Lynn Bustamante, \\n\\nThank you for contacting the Capital Area Food Bankâ€™s Customer Relations Department!

I wanted to reach out personally to follow up on the recent incident and to express my sincere apologies for any disruption it may have caused you.  I have escalated this matter to our Operations Director, and I want you to know that we have a new leader in Operations who is dedicated to ensuring we serve our partners with the utmost care and precision. She is committed to making improvements and has assured me that we are taking significant steps to prevent such situations from occurring in the future.   Some of the measures weâ€™re implementing include:  1. Continuing our routine pest control efforts. 2. Collaborating with our pest control company, which visited our facility on Monday to conduct additional work beyond our normal maintenance. 3. Strengthening our inspection processes to ensure that all pullers, drivers, and inspectors thoroughly check every order once it\\'s staged. 4. Focusing on the quality of products going out to our partners. 5. Preparing for the warmer months ahead to maintain a rodent-free and clean environment for the food we deliver.  I truly empathize with the impact this situation may have had on your operations, and I want to assure you that we are committed to providing a better service moving forward. Please know that we value your partnership and appreciate your understanding during this time.  As a gesture of goodwill, we would like to waive the delivery fees for both your recent order and your upcoming order on March 3rd.  If you have any questions or concerns, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. Your feedback is important to us, and weâ€™re here to help.  Thank you for your understanding.  \\n\\nWarm regards,\\n\\n \"D\" ', 'Comment.4': '02/26/2025

The pallet you ordered will not be removed from your order and will be delivered on the 21st. \\n\\nHowever, this pallet has exceeded your agencyâ€™s produce limit of *250lbs*. At this time, due to the transition of implementing produce limits, we are not removing any produce from orders even if it exceeds their limit to allow partners to adjust. Once partners are more familiar of this process, we will begin adjusting orders, in communication with you, to have your orders align closer to your monthly allotted poundage. \\n\\nYou are able to continue submitting orders as your agency allows, but for the rest of this or any month, you will no longer be eligible to order more produce once the limit has been met or exceeded.\\n\\nPlease reach out to your Regional Team should you feel like an adjustment would be most beneficial for your agency.\\n\\nHope this helps!\\nCharity', 'Comment.4': '01/21/2025 07:01;qm:65d20c5a-0c84-458e-8ce1-adb90d07460f:923a4b1b-4d68-4352-a1bf-3c9151368dd6;Good Morning Charity,\\n\\nI wanted to confirm our conversation last week, that my order, S0191939 which includes a produce pallet, will be changed from pickup to  *delivery*.

Unfortunately, after researching our internal resources, I was unable to find guidance on snack-type items. We primarily use the Food Coding Guide to help partners navigate such questions. When there are gaps, we recommend relying on research and information available online, particularly the USDA website. Furthermore, we advise partners and clients to use their senses (sight, smell, and taste) to determine if a food is spoiled and unsafe to eat.[Food Product Dating | Food Safety and Inspection Service (usda.gov)|https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/food-product-dating]\\n\\n[Shelf-Stable Food Safety | Food Safety and Inspection Service (usda.gov)|https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/shelf-stable-food]\\n\\nI have also noted that for our development, I will raise this issue to our leadership.

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us; it is very valuable. I will follow up with the Transportation Leadership Team to address the way the drivers communicate with partners about this issue.\\n\\nTo provide some context, there are two main reasons why drivers may not take pallets when dropping off food during a delivery. Firstly, they may have food for an immediate order or need to pick up food from another site for the warehouse, which means they cannot have food and pallets on the truck at the same time due to food safety (Pallets are often leftoutside- on the ground, possibly in the rain, and are often dirty) and consideration for our partners. Secondly, our drivers may be on tight schedules and do not have the time for a pallet pickup due to their busy delivery schedules, especially during the busy season.\\n\\nThere is no reason why a driver could not explain this to you at the time, and I will ensure that this information is communicated to them. I apologize for your experience. \\n\\nThank you,\\n\\n\"D\"', 'Comment.1': '10/01/2024 10:21;61536ea272f6970069fc1dbd;I spoke with the Transportation Supervisor, and she mentioned that she received feedback about the pallets not being stacked properly and having trash around them. She has scheduled a pallet pickup for tomorrow. Please make sure that the pallets are stacked together to allow the equipment to pick them up easily, there is no debris around them, and they are placed on concrete, not on grass. Thank you!', 'Comment.2': \"10/01/2024 10:43;qm:65d20c5a-0c84-458e-8ce1-adb90d07460f:0263e065-5e9f-426c-8230-43d43b0d7e07;!image3.jpeg|thumbnail!\\n\\nThis is how the pallets were placed. We canâ€™t stack them any higher, so we have to put them to the side due to our limited space. The driver was rude, which is unusual, as weâ€™ve always had great relationships with all the other drivers.\\nThanks for picking the pallets soon. \\nMatilde  \\n\\n\\n{quote}On Oct 1, 2024, at 10:22â€¯AM, DH <partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org> wrote:\\n\\n{quote}\\n\\n{quote}\\nï»¿  \\n{color:#999999} â€”-â€”-â€”-â€”{color}  \\n{color:#999999} Reply above this line.{color}  \\n  \\n\\nDH commented: \\n\\nI spoke with the Transportation Supervisor, and she mentioned that she received feedback about the pallets not being stacked properly and having trash around them.

Thank you for providing this important information; it is definitely something we need to note.\\n\\nTo give you some background, partners have been charged delivery fees for orders that include a mix of TEFAP products and other donated or purchased items for some time. As stated in our SMART Shopping Policy, orders that contain only TEFAP products do not incur a delivery fee. However, orders that mix TEFAP with purchased or donated products do have a delivery fee associated with them.\\n\\nI do not have the ability to remove delivery fees from all orders, as these fees are automatically added when partners place their orders. I believe we will need to submit an ERP ticket to stop this charge permanently, as it is an automated process. \\n\\nTo clarify what the ticket would entail: Are we asking for no delivery fees to be applied to any orders containing any TEFAP items for al regions? Additionally, will we need to issue refunds for past orders that were charged delivery fees due to the mix of TEFAP and other products? I anticipate that partners will inquire about previous orders that included these fees as we proceed with this change and it also may be a good idea to plan for a formal communication to TEFAP partners since this is a change in poliy that we have previously stated to them. \\n\\nIs there a deadline for when this needs to be implemented? I understand that it should be done as soon as possible, but any changes/refunds to delivery fees are always approved by Austin, who is currently out until January 9th.\\n\\nThank you for bringing this matter back to our attention again, hope to resolve this as soon as possible! \\n\\nBest,  \\n\"D\"', 'Comment.1': '01/03/2025 05:19;6064f0ca1613f30068073e90;Hey \"D\", happy new year and thanks for your response!

I have reached out to our Head of Food Procurement about your inquiries and concerns. He has advised me that 8oz Milk is 9/6 but rush ship was requested. Applesauce cups 300081 will be in DC sometime next week. We do not currently carry cereal bowls or bottled water, or 2oz tuna.  He will do some research and let us know what he finds. Soups and apple juices are still TBD as well as we are working on stocking our new warehouse and are having shipments received at both locations.

Different programs within CAFB have different rules and regulations. TEFAP falls under the rules and regulations of MD DHS, collection of SDI forms is one of the requirements set forth by them not by myself or by CAFB. \\n\\n  \\n\\nI completely understand that the work that you and all your volunteers do is hard and exhausting work. We also understand that not everyone is able to, qualifies for, or feels comfortable completing the SDI form. This is why we do always recommend there be non TEFAP food set aside for those do not qualify or are unable to complete the SDI form. \\n\\n  \\n\\nMy goal is not to suspend New Hope and Life Church of God, it is to work with you and each partner to ensure there is compliance with regulations set forth by MD DHS, to work together when other problems arise, and to get to know each partner to the best of my ability so that I can continue to advocate for change at the state level. \\n\\n  \\n\\nRegarding the monthly inventory report for the month of August, like covered in the civil rights training, regardless of whether food was distributed a report must still be submitted. In the case of no distribution, you would just need to put 0 under the household and individuals served, note any inventory you have at the time, sign and submit. \\n\\nI can also look at your sales order record and send you the food ordered around that time frame which may help in the completion of the report. \\n\\n  \\n\\nI do want to remind you that I am out of town tomorrow Friday October 24th and Monday, October 28th. Like stated in the previous emails, what needs to be submitted on Wednesday, October 23rd is the signed corrective action plan, a summary of how you will be collecting SDI forms, and submission of the monthly inventory reports that have not yet been submitted. Submission of the reports can be through the links originally sent or if your organization completed the reports previously, they should have been sent an email copy of the report which can then be emailed to me. \\n\\n  \\n\\nI appreciate your patience, understanding and the work you and you organization does for the community. \\n\\n  \\n\\nBest, \\n\\nLucy \\n\\n  \\n  {color:inherit}\\n\\n {color}{color:#172B4D}{color}{color:inherit}{color}'}, {'Resolved': '07/18/2024 12:09', 'Description': 'send pm good morning want inquire go acquire password tell service multiple location good use password set do already suggestion make easy navigate remember operations operations need special character like add asterisk end', 'Custom field (Cause of issue)': 'Request of Customer Relations', 'Custom field (Request Category)': 'PartnerLink -> New Shopper', 'Custom field (Source)': 'Email to Jira', 'Comment': '07/17/2024 04:43;qm:65d20c5a-0c84-458e-8ce1-adb90d07460f:65f3e1aa-f2a3-4bed-8436-15af6fe24357;\\n\\n!Outlook-Logo  Desc.gif|thumbnail!', 'Comment.1': '07/17/2024 04:43;557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077;Hi partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org, \\n\\nWe just received your request for assistance.

Currently, we do not have a waitlist or a reminder system linked to our inventory to alert partners when items are back in stock. This is feedback we have received from partners and have conveyed to our Food Resourcing and Inventory Teams for consideration.\\nÂ\\xa0\\nIf you wish to check back during that time and do not see the catfish available, we would be happy to reach out to the TEFAP team to confirm if the shipment is still expected during that period. It seems that in your original order, the product went out of stock. Our inventory is live and operates on a first-come, first-served basis as you know. At times, items may be taken by the time you start the checkout process, resulting in an error message prompting you to update your item quantities based on what's available.\\nÂ\\xa0\\nAdditionally, there may be different lots of items with varying expiration dates. Consequently, you may have two lots of the same product arriving at different times, with one having a later expiration date than the other. Depending on the date of your order, the item may have gone out of stock for the specific case lot you selected, even though there are still some available on the menu. This occurs due to the date you chose for your order.\\nÂ\\xa0\\nWe acknowledge that our inventory system is complex and are striving to make it more user-friendly and accessible for partners to obtain information from the website.\\nÂ\\xa0\\nThank you,\\nCustomer Relations\"}, {'Resolved': '10/17/2024 12:07', 'Description': 'like ask drop date church order change am thank th', 'Custom field (Cause of issue)': 'Request of Customer Relations', 'Custom field (Request Category)': 'Orders - Pre delivery ->  Date/Time Change - New window', 'Custom field (Source)': 'Email to Jira', 'Comment': '10/15/2024 11:30;712020:b15fa988-bc60-49b4-aa6f-e30b7a3629c1;Good morning,\\n\\nThank you for contacting customer support.
