Hello Of late I am not getting a phone call letting me know that the driver is on their way to our Pantry I enter a note for each of our orders asking that a driver call as they are leaving the warehouse so that our volunteers have enough time to get to our location when the truck arrives We are a small organization and our Pantry is just that a large closet that stores a tremendous amount of food We deliver our food to the clients so there is no office available for volunteers to wait When I scheduled todays delivery a morning slot was not available I had written asking if there would be any way to move our delivery up since we are normally an early delivery partner I was told that the delivery schedule was full for the morning so that I had to keep my noon 2 pm slot I happened to be at the Pantry to do some stocking and the truck arrived at 10 AM Luckily we were able to meet the driver with no delay to his schedule I would appreciate it if drivers could please view the special notesinstructions for each delivery I have been told by a few drivers that they do not see the special notes on their delivery receipt Thank you for your help Angela Harvey Pantry Manager Bethesda Help,Customer requests that drivers view special notes and instructions for each delivery.,Ops Issue,Feedback - Concern / Negative -> Operations,112024 1205Good afternoon Angela I hope this message finds you well Thank you for your valuable feedback regarding our delivery process I will connect with our Transportation Team to clarify the issue and explore ways to improve it Each morning our Transportation Leadership prints out the days sales orders which should include the notes you and your team leave I will doublecheck to ensure this process is still in place as we established a notes section specifically for partners to provide important information for our drivers Additionally I want to mention that there are times when drivers may finish their deliveries earlier than expected or we may have more drivers available than anticipated In such cases drivers are instructed to call you to ask if you would like to receive your order before your scheduled delivery window If you decline they should wait until your designated delivery window I will reach out to confirm these details and will follow up with you I understand that the current situation is not ideal and the implications it has on your distribution Best regards | 112024 0224Good afternoon Angela I just spoke with Joe the Transportation Manager He informed me that he discussed the delivery process and the expectation for courtesy calls with the driver who made your delivery yesterday as well as the team of drivers during their morning meeting today Joe confirmed that drivers should be able to see the notes you leave on your sales orders More importantly it is mandatory for them to call all partners before their deliveries even if they are within the designated delivery window This call is to inform you that they are on their way In instances where drivers can make earlier deliveries they must consult with you first to see if you can accommodate the earlier arrival if not they are expected to wait until the agreed delivery window If you continue to experience issues regarding this matter please let me know and I will arrange for Joe to give you a call to discuss it further Best,Feedback - Concern / Negative -> Operations | Customer requests that drivers view special notes and instructions for each delivery.,-1,0.0,Shopping process explanation

Good afternoon I wanted to follow up with you all regarding the issue with Capital Christian Fellowships produce hub earlier this week CCF adds food and edits the SO I make for their produce hubs In the past few months they have added thousands of pounds of food to these orders making them close to 40k pounds sometimes For the most recent hub order someone at CCF accidentally removed 3k pounds of produce meant for the produce hub Christ let me know that this can happen since the produce is marked as available for agencies and CAFB staff We are having a meeting tomorrow with CCF to discuss the produce hub orders I wanted to reach out to you all to get your insight on whether it would be beneficial for TransportationOps If there is a specific pound limit that I should tell them not to exceed when adding food to the produce hub SOs I can do that as well I know that the produce limitations will impact their ordering so their order sizes will probably decrease in the next few months Please let me know if there is anything you would like me to mention during the meeting tomorrow Thank you again for all your help Best Grace Ferrara,Customer wants to discuss the issue with Capital Christian Fellowships produce hub and its impact on TransportationOps order sizes.,Partner Knowledge/Training,Orders - Pre delivery -> Report Issue,112024 12d61862e78f0544ada71f343edd30d657 | 112024 0237Good afternoon Grace I hope you are doing well I wanted to bring this matter to Austin and discuss it with her I understand the implications of the large orders and the concerns surrounding the removal of produce for the produce hub When I spoke to Austin she suggested that the first step should be to have a conversation with the partner to explain the implications of their edits to the order They need to be mindful that they donaTMt want to lose their produce items meant for the hub and that they should be aware of the weight of their orders when placing them Here are two key points I discussed with Austin 1 Currently we do not have a formal limit for orders so we cannot tell them what a limit would be Operations and ERPIT are working on measures to ensure that for large orders the number of delivery blocks corresponds appropriately For example two weeks ago Capital ChristianaTMs order required five trucks for delivery but only occupied one slot which is unrealistic For now we can only ensure that Operations is aware and prepared for these situations 2 Austin mentioned that if this situation continues to cause recurring issues and impacts the produce hubs participating sitesaresulting in a loss of produceawe can consider locking their orders for the produce hubs and requesting that they create a separate order However this could complicate matters since Operations has asked us to consolidate orders for the same partner to avoid having one sales order versus two We can explore this locking option as a last resort if recurring issues continue I hope this clarifies the situation and please let me know if you need any assistance in engaging with the partner Best,Orders - Pre delivery -> Report Issue | Customer wants to discuss the issue with Capital Christian Fellowships produce hub and its impact on TransportationOps order sizes.,21,1.0,order delivery issue

Good morning CAFB team I hope my email finds you well The form to make the request is no longer available which is why I am sending you this email CAFB has given our Food pantry a limit of 16250 pounds per month but we would be grateful if we could have a very higher produce allocation otherwise our distribution will be in trouble The first reason is that each week we have over 500 guests at our Food distribution and the number is only increasing We have 4 distributions in a month 16250 pounds per month is 8 pallets per month We cannot feed more than 500 people per week with only 8 pallets per month so we will be forced to reduce our distribution to 1 day per month instead of 4 per month 8 pallets is the minimum number of pallets of food we use for a single distribution in the month If you look at our order history for the past several months we have been doing 2 orders per week one on Tuesday and one on Wednesday in order to have enough produce for all the families that come The second reason is that CAFB is our only food supplier If you maintain the limit of 16250 pounds per month the question for us will be how are we going to get the difference in food that we will no longer have Having no other suppliers the only solution will still be to reduce the distribution days The third reason is that we do not make our choices based on the pound because we have the space in our Gym to store at least 40 pallets against the wall if they are pallets stored one on top of the other that makes us more than 80 and we can also store 12 pallets in our Food pantry room so we have plenty of space to store the food We make our choices taking into account the diversity of food because of the diversity of cultures who come to take the food I hope that all these explanations will make us find favor in your eyes so that you increase our pound limit Thank you in advance Be blessed,"Customer requests an increase in the monthly produce allocation for their food pantry, citing reasons such as the increasing number of guests, limited storage space, and the importance of diversity in the food provided.",Request of Customer Relations,Agency Administration -> Connection to CAFB Staff,112024 1128Good morning I hope you are doing well Thank you for sending this over The Regional Maryland Team will need this letter as they are responsible for managing all matters related to the Produce Limits Since I cannot forward tickets in the portal please send your email to Augusta Grace and Gaby on the Maryland Team Their email addresses are provided below Augusta Grace Gaby Best | 112024 0165d20c5a0c84458e8ce1adb90d07460f3e811295a79f43b59b948d895785c52aThank you so much | 112024 01f58131cbb67d43c7b30d6b58d40bd077Customer has replied after the ticket has been resolved,"Agency Administration -> Connection to CAFB Staff | Customer requests an increase in the monthly produce allocation for their food pantry, citing reasons such as the increasing number of guests, limited storage space, and the importance of diversity in the food provided.",14,0.8974637597952179,Produce Allocation

Ms Jackson Gaithersburg HELP is an allvolunteer organization that has been serving the needy in our local community for 56 years and we are dedicated to supporting as many families with food each month as we can In fact last month HELP served 500 families at our pantry in the Festival Shopping Center We have only a couple of volunteer drivers who can deliver food and we must reserve that service for those individuals who live alone or have a partner who also cant drive to the pantry You had asked for us to deliver food to a family of 9 people As you must know from your previous food pickups which total 30 since 2018 we pack according to family size and that would not be appropriate when there are ablebodied family members in residence As an allvolunteer organization we strive to serve as many families as possible but we can sustain our operation only if almost all of our families pick up at the pantry If a client needs to come to the pantry via bus we offer bus tokens so that transportation to and from the pantry is free It is not an insult to let someone know that we have limited capabilities for food delivery Its just a fact And we would not ask to see proof of disability We explain our limited delivery ability to any client who asks about delivery Also our coordinators always provide information about how to get food from Manna andor the Gaithersburg Hope Center Clients can get food from us while also getting food from those other organizations In that way we hope clients find they have more money to apply toward rent or utility bills Our yearly client survey results validate that outcome and that our volunteers treat clients with dignity and promptness We could serve your family very quickly with food if someone could drive to the pantry or come via bus Margo On Thu Nov 14 2024 at 2 Dear Capital Area Food Bank Support Team My name is Yvette Jackson and I am writing to report an issue I experienced with food assistance delivery from Gaithersburg HELP On Monday at 954 pm today indicating that the refusal and statement were correct due to the volunteer nature of the service and their inability to deliver help to a large household I was directed to seek assistance from other sources such as Manna Food I believe there might be a misunderstanding or miscommunication regarding our eligibility for this service Attached to this email you will find documentation of my disability for your review Please note the MetroAccess document on line 16 which indicates that my disability prevents me from independently using the accessible Metrobus and Metrorail system for all trips I am unable to walk due to L spine disease with a risk of falls panic attacks anxiety and nontolerance to crowds At this point I feel my disability age and household circumstances are severely limiting my access to essential help I would appreciate your assistance in reviewing this matter and providing any necessary support to ensure that my household can receive the food assistance we need as it appears Gaithersburg Help is not completely meeting the needs of the community I value your prompt attention to this issue and look forward to your

up when I had a vehicle but there have been times when delivery was accommodated before having transportation around 2018 Just so you are aware working doesnt automatically mean someone is ablebodied typically refers to a person who has no physical disabilities and can perform tasks without any limitations caused by a disability Many people with disabilities or health conditions can still work

Hi Partner Support We were told that cases of fresh vegetables would be available some time ago They are never available when were placing our orders So does that mean they are really never going to be available anymore for small sites with no dock availabilty We have not been able to pick up fresh vegetables since Covid began and inhouse shopping was discontinued Your positive response would be appreciated MaryAnn Tolbert,Customer is inquiring about the availability of fresh vegetables and expresses frustration with the lack of availability.,Request of Customer Relations,Orders - Pre delivery -> Produce Request,012025 0814Good afternoon Thank you for reaching out to Customer Relations I appreciate your inquiry We offer a variety of fruits and vegetables on our menu throughout the week but the selection can vary depending on seasonal availability During the winter months for example we typically have fewer options compared to the summer when a wider variety of produce is available In recent weeks the fruits and vegetables available have primarily included potatoes apples and carrots Due to producelimitations placed on agencies our Food Resources Team is working to bring in more produce items in case lot instead of large bins and full pallets but this remains an ongoing challenge Currently all produce items must be ordered through PartnerLink as there are no plans to reopen the agency mart for direct pickups I have two suggestions to enhance your experience in this situation First you can place orders up to 10 days in advance of your scheduled pickup and delivery date I recommend placing your order as soon as the calendar opens and frequently checking PartnerLink for available produce You can edit and add to your order until it locks for fulfillment which is three business days prior to the shipment date This flexibility allows you to include any additional items you may find during that 10day window Another option is to explore our TEFAP program a governmentsubsidized initiative through which participating partners can access additional items to supplement their regular orders Please note that this program has specific requirements and is managed by the TEFAP team For more information you can reach out to Zaynab the DC TEFAP coordinator Thank you Best regards,Orders - Pre delivery -> Produce Request | Customer is inquiring about the availability of fresh vegetables and expresses frustration with the lack of availability.,12,1.0,Add Vegetables

reaching out about this Let me know if I can help with anything else Alanna Food Recall Policy A food recall as defined by the FDA involves removing foods from the market that violate the regulations set by the US Food and Drug Administration Foods are recalled for various reasons primarily due to contamination or failure to disclose essential allergens on the product label Its important for food suppliers and distributors to stay informed about recalls as consuming recalled foods may lead to illness or injury If a product is recalled the details will be specific to the item reflecting the brand product name freezeby date and other relevant information pertaining to that specific product Items that do not match the description provided in the recall notice are not affected and can be safely consumed In the event of a recall it is recommended to return the product to the place of purchase or dispose of it to prevent consumption The Capital Area Food Bank constantly monitors FDA food recall notifications and maintains regular contact with vendors and suppliers In the event that we are made aware of a recalled inventory item we will take immediate steps to remove it from all upcoming orders and notify our partners who may have received the item since it was added to our menu Our Customer Service Team will use various communication channels to promptly inform all partners about the recall and the necessary steps to take with the product If you have received an item from Capital Area Food Bank that you suspect has caused illness please contact Customer Relations immediately Provide your contact information the date and time of the distribution where the food was distributed to clients a description of the issue with the product the item numbername the date you received the product from our warehouse and any illness or injury resulting from consuming the item The Customer Relations Team will handle your complaint seriously and alert the relevant teams at

afternoon Thank you for reaching out to Customer Service You had a great question about our recall process For our DDP programs the recall outreach process differs from that of the partnership teams

responsibility to reach out to their clients For DDP the process is slightly different I recommend contacting Jessica Arias one of our managers on the DDP team to learn more about how they notify

Dear Partner Support Last Friday 225 sale order SO194429 was delivered to our location It included 3 bins of cereal item 100862 At first sight we noticed rodent droppings on top of cereal boxes in one of those bins That bin was not accepted and the delivery driver loaded it back up inside his truck The other two bins were b ought upstairs to our storage room To our surprise a few minutes later we saw a mouse coming out of one bin and returning inside that bin We had to act quickly since other food items were stored inside this room We immediately wrapped both bins loaded them inside our vehicle and drove to two landfill sites to dispatch the two open bins with donated assorted cereal Upon dispatching them our staff saw two mice This confirmed our fear that more than one mouse had entered inside our building and our storage room through the open bin cereals that we ordered Of course the issue was not over and the following Monday 225 we caught another mouse We will continue to closely monitor our storage room and other areas to be certain that the problem has been eradicated Attached are pictures of what was left behind after we removed the two bins out of the storage room This experience was very disturbing and a solution needs to be implemented quickly This put us behind schedule by four days due to the intervention that we put in place We also had to throw away our products that the mice had contaminated CAFB has been such a great partner to us and we are forever grateful for the all in support that you have been providing us to allow us to help our underserved communities That is why we are sharing this information and our experience to you so this can be further looked at and hopefully avoided We are in this together to strengthen food security so we know this kind of issue will be attended to and taken seriously by both parties We look forward to your feedback or resolution around this matter Thank you and Best regards Anna Beavan and Jeannette Mendy

Lucy First let me thank you and the TEFAP program for allowing us to serve We have been a part of the Capital Area Food Bank since 2009 thats 15 years of service The volunteers that come to work with us do so at the kindness of their heart Our Community is multcultural People who are afraid of the impact of completing the form At the Civil Rights meeting I asked the question of how we can educate the community to help them understand that they wouldnt lose their benefits by completing the form By saying you cant have food unless you fill out the form is heartbreaking We are doing what we can and to constantly be threatened of suspension is not a good feeling I cant imagine any agency taking such steps over FOOD These volunteers have worked tirelessly If you need to come and get the foods we have please feel free to do so Let us know the date and time so that someone will be available I spoke to Cynthia and she informed me that was distributed in August I will do the inventory send you the forms we collected and that is all we can do Best Dr Claudine Head On Thu Oct 24 2024 at 9 Good Morning Dr Head I thought it would be best to answer on this email thread as you can more easily refer back to the Corrective Action Plan attached to the first email I appreciate you sending along the pictures of the temperature logs and the civil rights training certificate The Corrective Action Plan outlines 2 issues the missing SDI forms and missing inventory reports The due date of 102024 was for the signed Corrective Action Plan to be emailed back to me along with a plan to prevent this issue from happening again in the future please see the last bullet point below each issue and lastly the missing inventory reports to be submitted In your case that is May and August of 2024 Like said in one of the emails below if you submitted the missing months you should have received an email with a PDF copy via email If you could send me that then it would clear up the missing inventory reports Since I will be out of town tomorrow Friday 1028 I will allow for one additional extension The new date is Wednesday October 30th 2024 Please know that if these items are not submitted by end of day on October 30th there will be a suspension placed on your TEFAP account Any suspension that I do does not impact your ability to order regular CAFB food To recap the final submission deadline for the signed CAP summaries and missing reports are due by End of Day 5pm on Wednesday October 30th I hope this clarifies any confusion Best Lucy MD TEFAP Coordinator Capital Area Food Bank

Below are some clarification points Monthly Inventory Reports I have attached what I am able to see on my end as far as submitted reports If you submitted them you should have received an email with a

sheets see attached document for reference If you could please let me know which day you attended then I can send you the PDF copy for you to sign and return If you need any further clarification on either of the topics above we can do a phone call tomorrow or Friday Best Lucy From New Hope And Life Church of God Wednesday October 16 2024 at 156a PM Lucy Paredes Re Corrective Action Plan New Hope and Life Church of God Good afternoon Lucy Im not sure I understand These surveys were completed already I signed the roster when I came into the training Also the certificate is at the Church You and I spoke at the training when you told me about the corrective action We will sign the corrective action plan and send it back next week Dr Head On Wed Oct 16 2024 at 1 Good Afternoon Dr Head Attached please find the corrective action plan for New Hope and Life Church of God The following are the links for the monthly inventory reporting May 2024 August 2024 Dr Head could you please confirm your attendance for the civil rights training by sending the certificate received Once received I will forward you the signin sheet for you to sign and verify that you or a representative did indeed attend

102024 01e3f1b9a5afcd4846bd163cc8c3d8a80cDr Head We appreciate the wonderful service you provide to your community and your partnership with CAFB for the last 15 years Different programs within CAFB have different rules and regulations TEFAP falls under the rules and regulations of MD DHS collection of SDI forms is one of the requirements set forth by them not by myself or by CAFB I completely understand that the work that you and all your volunteers do is hard and exhausting work We also understand that not everyone is able to qualifies for or feels comfortable completing the SDI form This is why we do always recommend there be non TEFAP food set aside for those do not qualify or are unable to complete the SDI form My goal is not to suspend New Hope and Life Church of God it is to work with you and each partner to ensure there is compliance with regulations set forth by MD DHS to work together when other problems arise and to get to know each partner to the best of my ability so that I can continue to advocate for change at the state level Regarding the monthly inventory report for the month of August like covered in the civil rights training regardless of whether food was distributed a report must still be submitted In the case of no distribution you would just need to put 0 under the household and individuals served note any inventory you have at the time sign and submit I can also look at your sales order record and send you the food ordered around that time frame which may help in the completion of the report I do want to remind you that I am out of town tomorrow Friday October 24th and Monday October 28th Like stated in the previous emails what needs to be submitted on Wednesday October 23rd is the signed corrective action plan a summary of how you will be collecting SDI forms and submission of the monthly inventory reports that have not yet been submitted Submission of the reports can be through the links originally sent or if your organization completed the reports previously they should have been sent an email copy of the report which can then be emailed to me I appreciate your patience understanding and the work you and you organization does for the community Best Lucy,Agency Administration -> Connection to CAFB Staff | The customer is requesting clarification on missing inventory reports and civil rights
