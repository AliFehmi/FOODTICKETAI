that come to work with us do so at the kindness of their heart Our Community is multcultural People who are afraid of the impact of completing the form At the Civil Rights meeting I asked the question of how we can educate the community to help them understand that they wouldnt lose their benefits by completing the form By saying you cant have food unless you fill out the form is heartbreaking We are doing what we can and to constantly be threatened of suspension is not a good feeling I cant imagine any agency taking such steps over FOOD These volunteers have worked tirelessly If you need to come and get the foods we have please feel free to do so Let us know the date and time so that someone will be available I spoke to Cynthia and she informed me that was distributed in August I will do the inventory send you the forms we collected and that is all we can do Best Dr Claudine Head On Thu Oct 24 2024 at 9 Good Morning Dr Head I thought it would be best to answer on this email thread as you can more easily refer back to the Corrective Action Plan attached to the first email I appreciate you sending along the pictures of the temperature logs and the civil rights training certificate The Corrective Action Plan outlines 2 issues the missing SDI forms and missing inventory reports The due date of 102024 was for the signed Corrective Action Plan to be emailed back to me along with a plan to prevent this issue from happening again in the future please see the last bullet point below each issue and lastly the missing inventory reports to be submitted In your case that is May and August of 2024 Like said in one of the emails below if you submitted the missing months you should have received an email with a PDF copy via email If you could send me that then it would clear up the missing inventory reports Since I will be out of town tomorrow Friday 1028 I will allow for one additional extension The new date is Wednesday October 30th 2024 Please know that if these items are not submitted by end of day on October 30th there will be a suspension placed on your TEFAP account Any suspension that I do does not impact your ability to order regular CAFB food To recap the final submission deadline for the signed CAP summaries and missing reports are due by End of Day 5pm on Wednesday October 30th I hope this clarifies any confusion Best Lucy MD TEFAP Coordinator Capital Area

evening Dr Head Below are some clarification points Monthly Inventory Reports I have attached what I am able to see on my end as far as submitted reports If you submitted them you should have received an email with a PDF copy via email If you could send me that then it would clear up the missing inventory reports Civil Rights Training I did remember talking with you however I did not see your name on the sign in sheets see attached document for reference If you could please let me know which day you attended then I can send you the PDF copy for you to sign and return If you need any further clarification on either of the topics above we can do a phone call tomorrow or Friday Best Lucy From New Hope And Life Church of God Wednesday October 16 2024 at 156a PM Lucy Paredes Re Corrective Action Plan New Hope and Life Church of God Good afternoon Lucy Im not sure I understand These surveys were completed already I signed the roster when I came into the training Also the certificate is at the Church You and I spoke at the training when you told me about the corrective action We will sign the corrective action plan and send it back next week Dr Head On Wed Oct 16 2024 at 1 Good Afternoon Dr Head Attached please find the corrective action plan for New Hope and Life Church of God The following are the links for the monthly inventory reporting May 2024 August 2024 Dr Head could you please confirm your attendance for the civil rights training by sending the certificate received Once received I will forward you the signin sheet for you to sign and verify that you or a representative did indeed attend the training If you did not attend please let me know and I will send along the last 2 makeup dates I am here to help and support in any way that I can so please feel free to reach out to me via email as this is the best way to be able to refer back to information if there were ever any followup questions or concerns I am also happy to touch base via phone call and
