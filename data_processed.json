I am writing to inform you that you can only apply one grant to a single line item. Currently, you have a remaining balance of $30.17 on your 1-H grant, which the system is trying to use to cover the cost of your 300015 Macaroni & Cheese. If you order a line item that costs more than $30.17, you will still have a balance. However, if you would like to use your other grant, which has a larger balance and can cover the entire line item cost of $202.44, we can arrange that for you so that you won't have any remaining balance to pay for this sales order.\n\nPlease let me know which grant you would like to use, and I will put in a ticket with my IT team to make the necessary changes.\n\nThank you,\n\nDaniele",

My initial thought is that the balance could be for an item that is not grant eligible, such as a donated item. Are all items on your order grant eligible?

If you are in editing mode, which means you clicked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Edit Order\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and you are viewing your card- there will be error messages saying that there are zero availability because there is no more left of that item to add to your order. Whatever you had on your order before starting to edit the order is secured but the error message is saying that there is no more of this item available to add more of. \n\n2.) If you did not hit save, which I see that you said you did- then you could have lost of the items. Previously, the old system held in the carts for 24 hours, but that is no longer the case. \n\n3.) The last instance is that throughout the day, our warehouse team members are continuously doing quality checks. If for any reason produce fails that quality check or the warehouse team deems it as not being able to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmake it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (quality wise) to the date it's supposed to be delivered it can be taken off of your order. \n\nI am looking at your order and I do see eggplant, potatoes, cucumbers and squash on your orders. \n\n\"D\" ",

Once you complete the checkout process, your items are put on a sales order and finalized. The emails you receive are due to potential errors in our inventory or the pulling process that may cause changes to your order before delivery.\n\nThis can happen for two main reasons. Firstly, if the pulling team finds that the item's quality is not up to our standards for delivery, it may be removed from your order or the quantity decreased. This can occur when partners place orders well in advance and by the time the order is picked, the item may no longer meet our quality standards.\n\nSecondly, if we run out of a certain product, this could be due to periodic inventory errors where the actual count of items doesn't match what's on the menu.\n\nWhile we strive to minimize these occurrences, we send email notifications to keep partners informed in case such changes are necessary before their order is fulfilled.\n\nThank you,\n\n\"D\"",

This way, we can help reschedule orders to a later date if possible.\n\nPlease note that the Capital Area Food Bank does not follow government decisions regarding weather closures and delays. Our Operations Department and leadership team make decisions about our operating hours based on weather and road conditions to ensure the safety of our drivers and partners.\n\nThe earliest time I can schedule your order is January 13th.

Unfortunately, we cannot provide specific expiration dates for these items. When a product is labeled as \"assorted,\" it means it is a compilation of dozens of different products under that category that have been donated. These items are sorted by our volunteer teams or donated in bulk. \n\nWhile our volunteers are instructed not to include expired foods, items that are past their \"best by\" or \"sell by\" dates are considered acceptable for consumption and may still be included. We encourage all partners receiving these donated cases to be aware of this and to use the Food Coding Guide created by our Food Resources team and Nutrition Department. Additionally, we recommend using your knowledge of food safety and your senses (sight, smell, and texture) to determine if the food is in good condition.\n\nI apologize for not being able to provide further guidance on this matter. The nature of donated products, especially assorted bins, makes it difficult to pinpoint a specific expiration date for a mix of different items.\n\n[^Food Coding Guidance.pdf]\n\nThank you,  \n\"D\"",

We typically ask them for a picture of the product with the exp. dates. If the item expires, I can ask \"D\" for a refund/credit.

        "Comment.9": "10/29/2024 03:50;61536ea272f6970069fc1dbd;_Hi Alanna- it will not allow me to remove you as the reporter of this ticket, do you mind passing this along? Thank you!_ \n\nGood afternoon,\n\nThank you for submitting this ticket to Customer Service. I have reviewed your reported issues and consulted with my colleagues in our Food Resources and Operations Teams.\n\nRegarding the tortillas, I apologize that they were sent out after their expiration date. I have reported this to the Food Resources Team for further investigation. However, since you received them, I have processed a credit of $45.60 for the tortillas you ordered (which had a discount applied). This credit will be applied to the invoice associated with your order, Invoice #180569.\n\nAs for the flavored water, the date on the items indicated \"BB,\" which stands for \"best by.\" Many of our donated foods may be past their best by or sell by dates. These dates are intended to inform you of when the item is not at its peak quality, not about food safety. The items are still safe to consume, and we encourage our partners to use their judgment. If there are any signs of concern\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsuch as changes in taste, smell, or packaging\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddo not distribute the item and please let us know.\n\n[^Food Coding Guidance.pdf]\n\nThank you,\n\n\"D\"",

I will connect with our Transportation Team to clarify the issue and explore ways to improve it. Each morning, our Transportation Leadership prints out the day's sales orders, which should include the notes you and your team leave. I will double-check to ensure this process is still in place, as we established a notes section specifically for partners to provide important information for our drivers.  Additionally, I want to mention that there are times when drivers may finish their deliveries earlier than expected, or we may have more drivers available than anticipated. In such cases, drivers are instructed to call you to ask if you would like to receive your order before your scheduled delivery window. If you decline, they should wait until your designated delivery window.  I will reach out to confirm these details and will follow up with you. I understand that the current situation is not ideal and the implications it has on your distribution. \n\nBest regards,  \n\n \"D\"",

He informed me that he discussed the delivery process and the expectation for courtesy calls with the driver who made your delivery yesterday, as well as the team of drivers during their morning meeting today. \n\nJoe confirmed that drivers should be able to see the notes you leave on your sales orders. More importantly, it is mandatory for them to call all partners before their deliveries, even if they are within the designated delivery window. This call is to inform you that they are on their way. In instances where drivers can make earlier deliveries, they must consult with you first to see if you can accommodate the earlier arrival; if not, they are expected to wait until the agreed delivery window.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues regarding this matter, please let me know, and I will arrange for Joe to give you a call to discuss it further.\n\nBest,  \n\"D\"",

This is feedback that we have received across the regions and I have communicated it to the Operations Teams for their awareness. For now, please relay the message below to the partner: \n\n_Good afternoon- The Customer Relations Team has reported your concerns to our Senior Managers in Operations, and they are committed to helping our partners address these challenges. They will be reviewing options to improve the situation moving forward. For the time being, items will continue to be packed as they are currently, but the team is looking into alternatives that would make unpacking easier for you and other agencies.  I will keep you updated on any developments. I want to assure you that your feedback has been heard and is being taken into consideration.   The reason for the current packing method is due to truck capacity. If the pallets are not stacked, they will take up more space in the truck and could potentially require multiple trucks for delivery. Our drivers carry pallet jacks with them on their routes, but they do not have reach machines like those used in the warehouse to pull orders and unstack items.  We are working on this, and I apologize for the challenges it presents. Please reach out to patnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.orgwith with any concerns you may have._ \n\n Best regards,  \n\n \"D\"",

        "Comment.1": "11/25/2024 02:37;61536ea272f6970069fc1dbd;Good afternoon, Grace,  \n\nI hope you are doing well. I wanted to bring this matter to Austin and discuss it with her. I understand the implications of the large orders and the concerns surrounding the removal of produce for the produce hub. When I spoke to Austin, she suggested that the first step should be to have a conversation with the partner to explain the implications of their edits to the order. They need to be mindful that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to lose their produce items meant for the hub and that they should be aware of the weight of their orders when placing them.  \n\nHere are two key points I discussed with Austin:  \n\n1. Currently, we do not have a formal limit for orders, so we cannot tell them what a limit would be. Operations and ERP/IT are working on measures to ensure that for large orders, the number of delivery blocks corresponds appropriately. For example, two weeks ago, Capital Christian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s order required five trucks for delivery but only occupied one slot, which is unrealistic. For now, we can only ensure that Operations is aware and prepared for these situations.\n\n 2. Austin mentioned that if this situation continues to cause recurring issues and impacts the produce hub's participating sites\u00e2\u20ac\u201dresulting in a loss of produce\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe can consider locking their orders for the produce hubs and requesting that they create a separate order. However, this could complicate matters since Operations has asked us to consolidate orders for the same partner to avoid having one sales order versus two. We can explore this locking option as a last resort if recurring issues continue. \n\n I hope this clarifies the situation, and please let me know if you need any assistance in engaging with the partner. \n\n Best,  \n\n \"D\"",

I have spoken to our Operations Manager in the DC warehouse, and unfortunately, we are unable to unstack or repack the pallets of produce in a different manner due to the truck's space capacity and efficiency reasons. Packing the pallets differently would require sending multiple trucks, causing inefficiency, and we also do not have the bandwidth to unstack and unpackage the cases and pallets of produce for each partner participating in the produce hub. \n\nOne suggestion is that your agency acquire a pallet jack during the next round of capacity grants to assist with this issue. I will also pass this feedback on to the Operations Leadership team for consideration, but currently, our Operations Team cannot accommodate it under our current operating procedures.\n\nI apologize for this.\n\nThanks,\n\n\"D\"",

I am writing in response to your recent produce requests, particularly your most recent message. I want to assure you that we do receive all of your produce requests. As we've mentioned before, we can only add produce that is available.\n\nCharity, the Customer Service Coordinator who has been assisting you, explained that we did not have any produce available on Monday. She assured you that she would monitor our inventory and add the produce to your order before it locks *if* it becomes available. Charity kept your ticket open and checked the menu regularly, but unfortunately, we did not have any produce to add to your order before it locked yesterday evening.\n\nI understand your frustration with this process, but please know that the produce we receive is put on the menu as soon as it is available. While my team supports partners by monitoring the menu, it would be best for you to also check the menu for updates. Unfortunately, we cannot add produce that is simply not available.\n\nI hope this provides some clarity. I also double-checked for any available produce before sending this message and saw that none was available.\n\nThank you,\n\n\"D\"\n\nManager of Customer Relations and Distribution Network Evolution (DNE) \u00c2\u00a0",

I removed it from our order and have been checking the menu since then, but I haven't seen any additional produce available. Even though your order is locked, I will continue to look out for produce today for your agency, as I understand the issues you've had with securing produce for your last two orders.

These donations will be provided at no cost now that the shared maintenance fee has been waived for donated items. _However_, *we cannot predict if and when these donations will arrive*. Typically, individuals and organizations tend to donate turkeys closer to Thanksgiving, usually in the week before the holiday or during the holiday week itself. \n\nPlease continue to check the menu regularly to see if turkeys are added. If we do receive them, they will be added to the menu and available to partners on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nThank you,  \nDH",

Thank you for reaching out to me again regarding the turkey availability. I completely understand how important this is for your community, especially during the holidays. \n\n  \n\nI want to clarify that all the turkeys we receive are available on a first come, first served basis for all our partners, just like other items on the menu. I also realize that in previous years, there was a fee associated with our donated turkeys (0.19 cents per pound). However, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pleased to share that this fee has been waived for this fiscal year, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible you may have paid in the past but you would not have to this time for the donated product. \n\n  \n\nI genuinely want to ensure that you and your clients receive the support you need this holiday season. I understand how quickly these items can disappear from the menu, and I encourage you to check it daily, as we frequently add new products. Right now, we also have vegetable oil, stuffing mix, corn muffin mix, canned collard greens, and beans that might help supplement your holiday distributions. \n\n  \n\nPlease feel free to check the menu regularly, and if I see any additional turkeys come available, I will reach out to you. \n\n  \n\nThank you for your understanding, and know that we are here to support you and your community during this important time. \n\n  \n\nWarm regards,  \n\n\"D\"{color:#4E8227}{color} \n\n  \n\n!image001.png|thumbnail!{color:#4E8227}{color} \n\n *{color:#4E8227} *DH*{color}*{color:#4E8227}{color} \n\n{color:#4E8227}Manager of Customer Relations & Distribution Network Evolution{color}{color:#4E8227}{color} \n\n {color:#4E8227}Capital Area Food Bank{color}{color:#4E8227}{color} \n\n *{color:#4E8227} *P.*{color}*{color:#4E8227} 571.390.9875 |  *F.* 703.541.0179{color}{color:#4E8227}{color} \n\n[{color:#0563C1}dharmon@capitalareafoodbank.org{color}|mailto:dharmon@capitalareafoodbank.org] \n\n{color:#3A7C22}4900 Puerto Rico Ave, NE Washington DC 20017{color}{color:#4E8227}{color}{color:windowtext}{color} \n\n  \n\n!image002.png|thumbnail!{color:windowtext}{color} <[https://www.facebook.com/CapitalAreaFoodBank]>{color:windowtext}{color}!image003.png|thumbnail!{color:windowtext}{color} <[https://www.linkedin.com/company/capitalareafoodbank]>{color:windowtext}{color} !image004.png|thumbnail!{color:windowtext}{color} <[https://twitter.com/foodbankmetrodc]>{color:windowtext}{color} !image005.png|thumbnail!{color:windowtext}{color} <[https://www.instagram.com/capitalareafoodbank/]> \n\n  \n\n{color:red}Please email all customer service questions or concerns to{color} [{color:red} {color}{color:red} *partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org*{color}{color:red} {color}|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org]{color:red} so that one of my colleagues or I can assist you promptly.

I would be happy to connect with you to discuss any challenges you are having. \n\nRegarding the turkeys, unfortunately, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the capacity to track every partner that has received turkeys in the past, and it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fair to our other partners to reserve inventory for a select few. However, there are times when we will receive a donation that is specifically allocated for the DC region. While this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a guarantee that we will receive such a donation, nor a promise to reserve anything, the regional team has made note of your interest and will notify you if we receive a special donation of turkeys for the region. As \"D\" mentioned, I also encourage you to continue checking PartnerLink so you will be aware as new items are added.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions for the DC regional team. Thank you for your continued partnership and the work you are doing to serve our community.\n\nBest,\nLaura\n\n",

We are writing to inform you that your current produce limit is 6,250lbs, and you are currently exceeding that limit by 3,250lbs. In order to align your order with your limit, we will need to remove some items from your current produce order.\n\nBelow is the list of produce items in your order:\n\n* 700759 Produce Pallet - 3 WAY - Onions, Potatoes, Apples - Quantity: 5\n\nPlease respond to this email with your selections of which produce items you would like us to remove. Kindly note that if we do not receive your response within 24 hours, our Customer Relations team will make adjustments to your order on your behalf.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter!\n\nBest regards,  \nCustomer Relations ",

Our Return Policy, which is covered in our SMART Shopping Training, informs partners that any order discrepancies must be reported immediately. We provide partners with 24 hours for perishable items and 72 hours for non-perishable items to notify us about returns, exchanges, or any issues with their orders. We also encourage all partners to thoroughly review their orders upon delivery or pickup, so they can inform us about any discrepancies as soon as possible. I understand that circumstances, such as delivery day events, holidays, and our holiday and snow closures, can sometimes disrupt this process which can acount in the delay in notification.\n\nUnfortunately, since the items you did not order have already been distributed and we are now beyond the timeframe for reporting discrepancies, the original account balance you paid for the order remains unchanged. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused your agency, especially regarding not receiving all the items you ordered. \n\nIn the future, if you experience any issues like this, please contact my team, the Customer Relations Team, immediately via email at [partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org]. This will automatically create a ticket for my team. You can also reach us at our shared phone number 202-644-9845.\n\nThank you,\n\nDH  \nManager of Customer Relations and Distribution Network Evolution",

I tried to checkout a couple of times and got the same message. I tried logging out and logging back in. When I logged back in the cart symbol at the top right was in the process of being emptied it was counting down. Which I thought was a good thing because when you actually get to place the order it does that usually. But once it was done counting down there wasn't a new sales order. I didn't check yet but I assume the time slot I had is no longer available for delivery? Do I just have to start all over and pick a different delivery day and time? Will I still need to do it in two orders and provide you with the two sales order numbers so you can change it to the same day and time? We usually use the invoice option when checking out but it wasn't available so we used the debit card. Once someone from your end took a bunch of items out the invoice option was available. So if this is something you can do from your end you wouldn't need the CC info you could just choose the invoice option for each order and set it up for this Thursday. Please advise.\n\n\nThanks, Jeff{adf}{\"type\":\"expand\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Jeff Haynie Bedrock Foundations, Inc. 301-627-1313 Ofc. 301-627-3691 Fax 301-440-3051 Cell\"}]}],\"attrs\":{\"title\":\"Signature\"}}{adf}",

I spoke to our IT Department this morning and wanted to relay some of the information that we discussed. First, the reason that you are unable to invoice your orders is because your agency has a balance over 90 days which means that your invoicing capabilities have been removed. Your agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance is $2,254.84. Until this amount is paid off, we will not be able to invoice any of your orders. Secondly, because we are unable to invoice your orders. We internally cannot place an order for you because we don't have access to your card information. I confirmed with our IT Team that the max number of items that PartnerLink will allow you to check out with is 21. The quantities do not play a factor into this, just the number of items themselves. If you are able to, please check out and place two orders to ensure you get all your items by place two orders that have 21 items. For reference, this is an issue that our IT Team is currently working on fixing so that we do not have to do this continuously. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience. \n\nIf you have questions about this, please feel free to give me a call at 571-390-9875\n\n\"D\" ",

I'm reaching out to address the deer meat that you ordered a few weeks ago. One of my team members informed me about the issue, and we've been in touch with our Operations Department. They initially located the meat in the warehouse, but upon further attempts, they couldn't find it, as we are preparing for inventory. We apologize for the inconvenience and any confusion caused by the back and forth communication.\n\nI've processed a courtesy credit of $15.20 for the total amount of the cases. Once approved by our Finance Department, this credit will be applied to Invoice 161606.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nThank you,\n\n\"D\"",

I am unsure why the delivery charge was added to SO180174, and will look into getting it removed. \n\nIf you would like to keep your deliveries free of charge moving forward, please make sure your order contains TEFAP products only.\n\nCharity",

We want to ensure that all the food leaving our warehouse is safe for consumption and properly dated for your knowledge. Some of the items you mentioned are *donated products*. As we increase the donated products on our menu, I want to make sure that all partners are aware that Capital Area Food Bank accepts donations with items past their best by and sell by dates.\n\nThe best by date is an indicator of the quality of a product but is not a safety date. The sell by date is for inventory management and tells the store for how long to display the product for sale. The product can still be consumed after this date. It's important to note that many of our donated products will be past these dates, but they are not expired and are still safe for consumption.\n\nWe have food coding guides that partners can print and reference during distributions. When available, they can be ordered in English and Spanish from our Nutrition Education Department. The dates on some products may cause concerns for partners and their clients, but we urge you all to differentiate between the different dates on products, use the food coding guide as a reference, and also use your best judgment as well as your food safety knowledge. If you have a product that is not of the right consistency, has an odor, or you believe to be not okay, please let us know and discard the item immediately. As we increase our donations, we may encounter some challenges, but please work with us and continue to provide us with feedback.\n\nAdditionally, if you ever have an issue with fresh produce, please include photos of the items so that we can forward them to our Operations and Food Resourcing Departments for their knowledge.\n\nWe appreciate your partnership with us in this.\n\nFor Nutrition Materials including the Food Coding Guide, please email: [education@capitalareafoodbank.org|mailto:education@capitalareafoodbank.org]\n\n[^Food Coding Guidance.pdf]\n\n\"D\"",

I'd be happy to assist you with your query.\n\nOur system applies grants on a per-line-item basis, meaning only one grant can be applied to each line item. In your past couple of orders, you have had line items with high numbers ranging from $250 to $2,653.30. \u00c2\u00a0The system is going to use the grant that has enough available funds which might not be the one with the closest expiration date. Please see below: \n\nYou have three grants:\n\n* 1-G $3,000 (Expires 1^st^)\n** SO136067 used $890.00\n** SO122558 used $812.60\n*** Remaining Balance: $514.98\n* 1-H $2,378 (Expires 2^nd^)\n** SO146902 used $762.58\n** SO142621 used $1,498.84\n*** Remaining Balance: $116.58\n* 1-I $6,564 (Expires 3^rd^)\n** *SO157471 (your most recent order)* _was placed and totaled in $854.20, the only grant that could cover the entirety of this line item for the chicken was your 1-I grant. If the system pulled from either of your other two grants, it would not cover the total cost of the chicken._\n\nI hope this clarifies the situation. If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask.\n\nBest regards,\n\n\"D\"",

From the photo you sent, it appears that the system indicated there was a quantity of 0 available for the selected date, and the \"Change Delivery Date\" button was highlighted. This makes me wonder if there was a discrepancy between your chosen date and the item\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expiration date. I will have them investigate this and I will follow up with you.\n\nBest,  \n\"D\"",

I have contacted the Maryland Regional Team and reviewed the documentation provided for the grant. Unfortunately, the grant can only be applied to orders with a creation date after February 10th, which is when the funds were uploaded to your accounts. Therefore, we cannot apply the grant to any orders created before February 10th, even if they were delivered after that date.\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know.\n\nBest,  \n\"D\"",

Many people with disabilities or health conditions can still work, often with the help of accommodations or support.\n\nSo, just because someone has a job, it doesn't necessarily mean they don't have a disability.

With Thanksgiving and the holiday season approaching, we understand the demand for turkeys from our clients and partners. We have two trucks scheduled that arrived in early October with purchased turkeys available on a first-come, first-served basis. Please note that these turkeys will not be free and will have associated costs.\n\nDonated turkeys are traditionally received closer to Thanksgiving. If our Food Resource Team is able to procure additional turkeys, they will also be available for purchase on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n*Customer Service cannot reserve or allocate turkeys for any partner.* If you are looking for alternative sources of turkey offerings or region-specific turkey donations, we recommend reaching out to your Regional Team.\n\nIt's important to note that Customer Service will *not* be involved in the allocation of turkeys. All turkeys, unless already pre-planned for, will be available on a first-come, first-served basis through PartnerLink.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation. \n\nCiArra",

        "Comment.3": "06/26/2024 04:51;61536ea272f6970069fc1dbd;Hi Andrea,\n\nI hope you are doing well. I wanted to talk to you about the ticket you submitted. I apologize for the delay. One of my team members brought up your concerns regarding some items you received from us. After discussing your concerns about the salad dressing with my management and the Food Sourcing Team responsible for all the food that comes into the Food Bank, here are some points I wanted to share with you.\n\nRegarding the salad dressing, our Food Resourcing Team does not have a specific recommendation for shelf-stable milk or salad dressing in our Food Coding Guide. We suggest following the USDA's recommendation regarding this product specifically and apologize for not being able to provide further insight. Partners and clients should use their eyes, noses, and, taste buds to determine if a food is spoiled and therefore unsafe to eat. Of course, if a product is showing any signs of spoilage such as rot, mold, foul odor, etc., we will accept a return. I have brought this issue to management's attention, and I agree that our Food Coding Guide needs improvement. I will raise this with our leadership for further review.\n\nIn response to your second point, I acknowledge the importance of best-by dates for our partners and their clients. However, our team faces challenges in obtaining these dates for donated products. One challenge arises during packing events when volunteers check and pack donated items into cases labeled as assorted on the menu. These assorted cases contain items from various donors and are packed without specific best-by date information for each individual product. Another challenge occurs when we receive donated products in different case lots-with different dates, making it difficult to provide accurate best-by dates to our partners. We don't know what case lot your order is going to be pulled from until its pulled the day before or two before its delivered or picked up. Although we practice FIFO (first in, first out) inventory management, the dynamic nature of our inventory makes it challenging to predict best-by dates with certainty. As our inventory of donated products increases, we are committed to improving our processes to provide partners with the information they need to make informed decisions. We are continuously seeking ways to improve our processes, and I encourage partners to participate in the upcoming  Partner meetings in July to address any questions or recommendations regarding product dates.\n\nThank you for bringing these concerns to our attention.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n\"D\"",

We offer a variety of fruits and vegetables on our menu throughout the week, but the selection can vary depending on seasonal availability. During the winter months, for example, we typically have fewer options compared to the summer when a wider variety of produce is available. \n\nIn recent weeks, the fruits and vegetables available have primarily included potatoes, apples, and carrots. Due to producelimitations placed on agencies, our Food Resources Team is working to bring in more produce items in case lot instead of large bins and full pallets, but this remains an ongoing challenge. Currently, all produce items must be ordered through PartnerLink, as there are no plans to reopen the agency mart for direct pickups.\n\nI have two suggestions to enhance your experience in this situation. First, you can place orders up to 10 days in advance of your scheduled pickup and delivery date. I recommend placing your order as soon as the calendar opens and frequently checking PartnerLink for available produce. You can edit and add to your order until it locks for fulfillment, which is three business days prior to the shipment date. This flexibility allows you to include any additional items you may find during that 10-day window.\n\nAnother option is to explore our TEFAP program, a government-subsidized initiative through which participating partners can access additional items to supplement their regular orders. Please note that this program has specific requirements and is managed by the TEFAP team. For more information, you can reach out to Zaynab, the DC TEFAP coordinator: [zkadhem@capitalareafoodbank.org|mailto:zkadhem@capitalareafoodbank.org]\n\nThank you!\n\nBest regards,  \n\"D\"",

I am writing to inform you that you can only apply one grant for a single line item. The system was trying to use the last of your 1-H Grant to cover the line for your peaches (#300387), but your 1-H Grant only had $316.14 left on it, which left a balance of *$505.46* and the same with the line with your macaroni and cheese (#300015), the system is trying to use the last of what was on your 1-G which was $141.07 but the line item had a total of $385.60 leaving a balance of *$244.53*. \n\n However, if you would like to use your other grant, Grant 1-I, which has a larger balance and can cover the entire line item costs we can arrange that for you so that you won't have any remaining balance to pay for this sales order.\n\nPlease let me know which grant you would like to use, and I will put in a ticket with my IT team to make the necessary changes.\n\nThank you,\n\nDaniele",

Yes, our Food Resources team, which is responsible for procuring food, including produce items at the Food Bank, was very much involved in the conversation and collaboration regarding the produce limits. One of their initiatives is to start procuring cases for our smaller agencies that have produce limits under 2,000 lbs.\n\nI also want to remind you that if you see a pallet of, for example, 2,000 lbs, the system will allow you to order over your limit. Customer Service will then reach out to you to discuss your options. If that is the only item available at that time and no cases are offered, we will permit the overage as long as it is not excessive.\n\nBest,\n\"D\"",

Could you please forward the response below on my behalf? Thank you!\n\n----\n\nGood afternoon,\n\nThank you for reaching out to Customer Service. You had a great question about our recall process. \n\nFor our DDP programs (mobile and community markets), the recall outreach process differs from that of the partnership teams. When a recall is identified, our Food Resources, Analytics, and Operations Teams collaborate with our programs and my team (Customer Relations) to contact the partners who ordered the affected items. It is then the partners' responsibility to reach out to their clients.\n\nFor DDP, the process is slightly different. I recommend contacting Jessica Arias, one of our managers on the DDP team, to learn more about how they notify their sites and assist those sites in informing their respective clients. \n\nHere is her contact information:\n\nJessica Arias  \n[jarias@capitalareafoodbank.org|mailto:jarias@capitalareafoodbank.org]  \n\nBest regards,  \n\"D\"",

Regarding the Produce Boxes, we have contacted your Regional Coordinators, Grace and Augusta, and they will communicate with Coastal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Customer Service Team to address the problem with your produce boxes that were not distributable. Augusta has offered to follow up with them and relay any next steps back to you.\n\nAs for the peanut butter, thank you for providing photos. We appreciate it. The peanut butter in your order, as well as many of our other donated items, have passed their \"best by\" date. This date indicates when the product will be at its best flavor or quality and is not a safety date. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quality date that encourages consumers to eat food while it is in its prime state. Food that is past this date is not bad and should not be thrown away. We provide a food coding guide to our partners that explains these dates further. We want to reassure you that the peanut butter is not expired and will not cause any harm to consumers. We offer the Food Coding Guides as a resource and we have them printed and available to order for partners as well to pass out at distributions. \n\n[^Food Coding Guidance.pdf]\n\nThank you,\n\n\"D\"",

        "Comment": "04/25/2024 04:57;61536ea272f6970069fc1dbd;Good afternoon,\n\nThank you for contacting our Customer Service. I'd be happy to assist you with your query.\n\nOur system applies grants on a per-line-item basis, which means that only one grant can be applied to each line item. In the case of your order, the line item is $817.00, and the system initially used the last of your FY24 MD Region Moco 1-G grant, which was $75.59. \n\nHowever, as per your request, I have contacted our IT department to apply your FY24 MD Region MOCO 1-I grant to that line item since it is the only grant you have that can cover the entire amount.\n\nPlease note that moving forward, the $75.59 remaining on your 1-G grant and the $18.01 left on your 1-H grant may not cover the entire line item cost. If this happens, it is because our system applies the grants on a per-line-item basis. If you have a line item that costs less than these amounts in future orders, then you will have no remaining balance.\n\nI hope this clarifies the situation. If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask.\n\nBest regards,\n\n\"D\"",
        "Comment.1": "04/25/2024 05:03;61536ea272f6970069fc1dbd;Do you plan on making any further changes to this order? If our IT department fixes this, and you add to the order it will revert back to the grant coverage you see now. If you do plan on editing your order, I will wait till next week to make the grant changes. Please let me know! ",

Blend biscuit mix and water to a soft dough. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface, knead several times. Pat or roll dough 1/2 inch thick. Cut with 2 inch floured cutter and place on ungreased baking sheet. Bake about 10 minutes. Drop Biscuits: Follow recipe above except do not knead. Drop by spoonful onto ungreased baking sheet. Bake 10-12 minutes._*\n\n*_Do not eat raw batter, dough or mix. Corn Muffins: Yield 6 - 8 muffins depending on size. 1 pkg. Jack & the Beanstalk Cornbread Mix and Corn muffin mix. 1 egg. 1/3 cup milk. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease muffin pan or use paper baking cups. Blend ingredients. Batter will be slightly lumpy. (for maximum crown on muffins let batter rest for 3 or 4 minutes, stir lightly before filling cups.) Fill muffin cups 2/3 full. Bake 15 - 20 minutes or until golden brown._*\n\n\u00c2\u00a0Thank you for your patience. \n\nDH ",

You can only remove the item from one order and then add that item to the other order but of course there is no guarantee that someone else might not take that available inventory. \n\nAdditionally, partners do not have the capability to edit the date of their order. You can send a request to partner support for your order date be to be updated, but we can only do so if there are available appointments and the new order date is more than 3 days in advance of the ship date. \n\nHope this information helps! \n\nBest, \n\nRiley ",

While I don't have a general answer, there are several factors at play. Firstly, at certain times of the year, we have constraints on our receiving calendar, which leads to fewer inventory trucks due to scheduling conflicts. Currently, we are facing this situation as we were closed for Juneteenth, went through our bi-annual inventory last week, and will also be closed for the July 4th observance next week. Additionally, as we prepare for our move back to home building in the Virginia region, there may be a slight shift in the amount of products as we transition inventory from one location to another. This means we have been and will continue to receive fewer trucks than usual and are trying to schedule loads that fit within this restricted schedule.\n\nMoreover, while donations vary, we are actively working to increase the amount of donated food we receive and make it available through our Partner Direct Program and the menu. This issue will be discussed in an upcoming in-person partner meeting in July, giving partners the opportunity to hear from our leadership and our Food Resourcing Team, who are responsible for sourcing all the food on the menu, both donated and purchased.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\nThanks,\n\n\"D\""

The hours listed are not the general hours of operation for your office or establishment, but instead indicate the days and hours when you distribute food. Your agency is listed as distributing food on Thursdays from 3pm to 5pm. You will be asked to confirm this information approximately once every quarter (or every 3 months). We will require you to log in and confirm that you are distributing food at the same time. To do so, please log into your account, go to the \"hours of operation\" tab, and click on 'verify' if the information is correct and unchanged. You can then proceed with your shopping. If you need to change your distribution hours, you should use the 'edit' button. This information is shared with the broader community, so it's important that our distribution hours are accurate. Thank you! Your account is now available for shopping.",

They have ordered 1,121 CASES of fruit (300 nectarines, 513 plums, 308 peaches), but they distribute to 280-350 households. This means that each household would receive at least 3 CASES of fruit.

I was very concerned to hear about the issues you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve encountered with mice droppings and the presence of mice near the food you received from us. Please know that I am genuinely sorry for this distressing experience, and I want to extend my heartfelt apologies on behalf of Capital Area Food Bank and our Customer Service and Operations Team.\n\nThis morning, I forwarded the information you provided in your ticket, along with your photos, to our Director of Operations. She is taking this matter very seriously and has scheduled a meeting with her team to ensure we find a prompt and effective resolution. They will be focusing on maintaining cleanliness and ensuring rodent protection in our facilities, as well as inspecting our warehouse products, particularly those in question, to ensure they are removed if necessary.\n\nI want to support you through this situation. Could you please let me know which specific products you needed to be disposed of due to the potential rodent issue, aside from the bins of cereal? I understand how disruptive this can be to your food distribution efforts, and I truly empathize with the challenges it presents in providing safe and healthy food to the community you serve.\n\nI will also reach out to my supervisor to discuss possible compensation for the inconvenience caused by this situation, as we value your partnership and want to make things right.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and once again, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m truly sorry for the trouble this has caused. We are committed to resolving this matter as quickly as possible.\n\nBest wishes,  \n\"D\"",

I wanted to reach out personally to follow up on the recent incident and to express my sincere apologies for any disruption it may have caused you.  I have escalated this matter to our Operations Director, and I want you to know that we have a new leader in Operations who is dedicated to ensuring we serve our partners with the utmost care and precision. She is committed to making improvements and has assured me that we are taking significant steps to prevent such situations from occurring in the future.   Some of the measures we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re implementing include:  1. Continuing our routine pest control efforts. 2. Collaborating with our pest control company, which visited our facility on Monday to conduct additional work beyond our normal maintenance. 3. Strengthening our inspection processes to ensure that all pullers, drivers, and inspectors thoroughly check every order once it's staged. 4. Focusing on the quality of products going out to our partners. 5. Preparing for the warmer months ahead to maintain a rodent-free and clean environment for the food we deliver.  I truly empathize with the impact this situation may have had on your operations, and I want to assure you that we are committed to providing a better service moving forward. Please know that we value your partnership and appreciate your understanding during this time.  As a gesture of goodwill, we would like to waive the delivery fees for both your recent order and your upcoming order on March 3rd.  If you have any questions or concerns, please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate to reach out. Your feedback is important to us, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here to help.  Thank you for your understanding.  \n\nWarm regards,\n\n \"D\" ",

I reached out to the warehouse and though we don't have the exact expiration date on the bin of chicken that you are expecting, food Services states that as long as the frozen item are frozen before the expiration date, it is still good to use and is why you received chicken that had already expired before. We freeze our meats well before the expiration date and keep them frozen to preserve the item. Additionally, all items also go through hefty quality checks before they are sent out to our partners. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. \n\n\"D\"",

I contacted our Food Resourcing Team, and they told me that they are unable to catalog the expiration dates for the chicken because of how much we get and the quantity of packs in each bin.

The expiration date, or use-by date, on food helps to estimate the expected timeframe that the food will still be at its highest quality.",

This means that your bill won't be finalized until after your order has been picked up or delivered, allowing for any changes you make during the processing phase. At that point, you can pay your invoice with your debit or credit card.\n\nThank you,",

Can you please edit our order so that we only receive one bin of corn? \n\nThanks again for your help. \n\nPeace,\nPastor Samantha",

You should see these updates reflected in your Sales Order on Partnerlink under the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Order History\u00e2\u20ac\u009d tab.

We encouraged all partners to attend one of the four trainings that we hosted between August and September to ensure that everyone was well-equipped to utilize this feature effectively. This feature is crucial for maintaining accurate information about your agency's operating hours, which in turn updates our [Get Help Map|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/] on the website. The Get Help Map is a tool that clients use to locate nearby CAFB Partners, so it's essential to have the correct hours displayed. If you were unable to attend the trainings, don't worry. There are alternative options available, such as accessing the resource on PartnerLink under the Partner Resources tab, or signing up for [Customer Relations Office Hours|https://capitalareafoodbank.zoom.us/zbook/partner-support/customer-relations-office-hours] held every Wednesday from 10am-11am. Please note that due to the nature of the training, there are no recordings or slides available, as it involved a live demo and Q&A session. While partners are not being reprimanded for not attending a training, it's important to highlight that starting *October 1st*, partners who have not updated or confirmed their hours will see a banner prompting them to do so before placing an order.

I have read your email and I am truly sorry to hear that you did not receive your applesauce in your last order. Upon checking, I found that we currently do not have any more free applesauce available on the menu. We will have to wait until the item is restocked before it can be added another order of yours. \n\nIn the meantime, I have rescheduled the delivery date of your SO153396, which includes the applesauce, to Wednesday the 27th. I had to keep the separate sales order for the applesauce because your produce order is on a different account (your push account). However, I have informed our Transportation Team to deliver both orders together and have waived the delivery fee for the applesauce.\n\nFurthermore, I have contacted our Transportation Team to schedule an immediate pallet pick-up. If they are unable to send a driver today, I have requested that the driver who delivers your order on Wednesday has enough space to pick up any remaining pallets after delivering your food.\n\nOnce again, I apologize for the inconvenience.\n\n\"D\"",

I have attached our Inclement Weather Policy below.\n\n[^Inclement Weather Policy.pdf]\n\nIn the event that it snows, we will wait for information from our leadership, including the Head of Operations, to determine if we will have a formal delay or closure - we do not follow the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions regarding weather. For example, if we announce a 2-hour delay, all delivery and pickup windows will be pushed back accordingly. This means that if you had an 8 AM - 10 AM delivery, it will now be scheduled for 10 AM - 12 PM.\n\nIf we face a complete closure due to the weather, there will be no deliveries or pickups. On such days, the Customer Relations team will be available to reschedule deliveries and reach out to all partners regarding their orders.\n\nAdditionally, please keep in mind that depending on the amount of snow, there may be impacts on the days following the snowfall. If we do have a closure, we will do our best to accommodate our partners' schedules while ensuring that orders are not affected the following day.\n\nI hope this helps! Please let me know if you need any further information.\n\nBest,  \n\"D\"",

The pallet you ordered will not be removed from your order and will be delivered on the 21st. \n\nHowever, this pallet has exceeded your agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s produce limit of *250lbs*. At this time, due to the transition of implementing produce limits, we are not removing any produce from orders even if it exceeds their limit to allow partners to adjust. Once partners are more familiar of this process, we will begin adjusting orders, in communication with you, to have your orders align closer to your monthly allotted poundage. \n\nYou are able to continue submitting orders as your agency allows, but for the rest of this or any month, you will no longer be eligible to order more produce once the limit has been met or exceeded.\n\nPlease reach out to your Regional Team should you feel like an adjustment would be most beneficial for your agency.\n\nHope this helps!\nCharity",

Furthermore, we advise partners and clients to use their senses (sight, smell, and taste) to determine if a food is spoiled and unsafe to eat.[Food Product Dating | Food Safety and Inspection Service (usda.gov)|https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/food-product-dating]\n\n[Shelf-Stable Food Safety | Food Safety and Inspection Service (usda.gov)|https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/shelf-stable-food]\n\nI have also noted that for our development, I will raise this issue to our leadership. I believe that having a more comprehensive tool would be incredibly useful for many partners.\n\n\"D\"",

I will follow up with the Transportation Leadership Team to address the way the drivers communicate with partners about this issue.\n\nTo provide some context, there are two main reasons why drivers may not take pallets when dropping off food during a delivery. Firstly, they may have food for an immediate order or need to pick up food from another site for the warehouse, which means they cannot have food and pallets on the truck at the same time due to food safety (Pallets are often leftoutside- on the ground, possibly in the rain, and are often dirty) and consideration for our partners. Secondly, our drivers may be on tight schedules and do not have the time for a pallet pickup due to their busy delivery schedules, especially during the busy season.\n\nThere is no reason why a driver could not explain this to you at the time, and I will ensure that this information is communicated to them. I apologize for your experience. \n\nThank you,\n\n\"D\"",

Thank you for providing this important information; it is definitely something we need to note.\n\nTo give you some background, partners have been charged delivery fees for orders that include a mix of TEFAP products and other donated or purchased items for some time. As stated in our SMART Shopping Policy, orders that contain only TEFAP products do not incur a delivery fee. However, orders that mix TEFAP with purchased or donated products do have a delivery fee associated with them.\n\nI do not have the ability to remove delivery fees from all orders, as these fees are automatically added when partners place their orders. I believe we will need to submit an ERP ticket to stop this charge permanently, as it is an automated process. \n\nTo clarify what the ticket would entail: Are we asking for no delivery fees to be applied to any orders containing any TEFAP items for al regions? Additionally, will we need to issue refunds for past orders that were charged delivery fees due to the mix of TEFAP and other products? I anticipate that partners will inquire about previous orders that included these fees as we proceed with this change and it also may be a good idea to plan for a formal communication to TEFAP partners since this is a change in poliy that we have previously stated to them. \n\nIs there a deadline for when this needs to be implemented? I understand that it should be done as soon as possible, but any changes/refunds to delivery fees are always approved by Austin, who is currently out until January 9th.\n\nThank you for bringing this matter back to our attention again, hope to resolve this as soon as possible! \n\nBest,  \n\"D\"",

Different programs within CAFB have different rules and regulations. TEFAP falls under the rules and regulations of MD DHS, collection of SDI forms is one of the requirements set forth by them not by myself or by CAFB. \n\n  \n\nI completely understand that the work that you and all your volunteers do is hard and exhausting work. We also understand that not everyone is able to, qualifies for, or feels comfortable completing the SDI form. This is why we do always recommend there be non TEFAP food set aside for those do not qualify or are unable to complete the SDI form. \n\n  \n\nMy goal is not to suspend New Hope and Life Church of God, it is to work with you and each partner to ensure there is compliance with regulations set forth by MD DHS, to work together when other problems arise, and to get to know each partner to the best of my ability so that I can continue to advocate for change at the state level. \n\n  \n\nRegarding the monthly inventory report for the month of August, like covered in the civil rights training, regardless of whether food was distributed a report must still be submitted. In the case of no distribution, you would just need to put 0 under the household and individuals served, note any inventory you have at the time, sign and submit. \n\nI can also look at your sales order record and send you the food ordered around that time frame which may help in the completion of the report. \n\n  \n\nI do want to remind you that I am out of town tomorrow Friday October 24th and Monday, October 28th. Like stated in the previous emails, what needs to be submitted on Wednesday, October 23rd is the signed corrective action plan, a summary of how you will be collecting SDI forms, and submission of the monthly inventory reports that have not yet been submitted. Submission of the reports can be through the links originally sent or if your organization completed the reports previously, they should have been sent an email copy of the report which can then be emailed to me. \n\n  \n\nI appreciate your patience, understanding and the work you and you organization does for the community. \n\n  \n\nBest, \n\nLucy \n\n  \n  {color:inherit}\n\n {color}{color:#172B4D}{color}{color:inherit}{color}",

I have discussed this matter with our leadership and the team involved in this initiative. We appreciate you reopening the discussion.\n\nWhen we initiated this plan, our goal was to alleviate the burden on our Tuesday schedule due to the number of large deliveries we have on that day. However, we acknowledge the challenges this has caused for your agency, which was not our intended outcome. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work together to find a solution!\n\nOne option I wanted to explore with you is whether you would be open to either receiving all your food items on Fridays or accepting deliveries on Mondays instead of Tuesdays.

I reached out to one of our managers in the ERP team, and she informed me that they are aware of this issue and are working to resolve it by tomorrow.\n\nThe weights in the shopping carts and your total weights are accurate, but the line weight calculation is currently incorrect and will be fixed soon. \n\nThis information is very helpful, and I appreciate you bringing it to our attention. Rest assured, this will be resolved by the time we begin our new product allocation process.\n\nBest regards,  \n\"D\"",

Currently, we do not have a waitlist or a reminder system linked to our inventory to alert partners when items are back in stock. This is feedback we have received from partners and have conveyed to our Food Resourcing and Inventory Teams for consideration.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you wish to check back during that time and do not see the catfish available, we would be happy to reach out to the TEFAP team to confirm if the shipment is still expected during that period. It seems that in your original order, the product went out of stock. Our inventory is live and operates on a first-come, first-served basis as you know. At times, items may be taken by the time you start the checkout process, resulting in an error message prompting you to update your item quantities based on what's available.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nAdditionally, there may be different lots of items with varying expiration dates. Consequently, you may have two lots of the same product arriving at different times, with one having a later expiration date than the other. Depending on the date of your order, the item may have gone out of stock for the specific case lot you selected, even though there are still some available on the menu. This occurs due to the date you chose for your order.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nWe acknowledge that our inventory system is complex and are striving to make it more user-friendly and accessible for partners to obtain information from the website.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThank you,\nCustomer Relations",
